HEAD -> points to branch reference of current branch
Branch reference -> points to latest commit of that branch
HEADLESS -> when we switch to a hash that is not latest commit

git branch    - list branches
git branch <name> - create branches (This does not automatically switch the branch)
git switch <name> - As soon as we switch, it retaing all the prev work/commits from master branch
